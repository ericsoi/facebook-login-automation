**Facebook Login Automation using Selenium - README**

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates how to automate the Facebook login process using the Selenium framework. With this script, you can automate the login procedure and interact with Facebook's web interface programmatically.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Selenium library
- ChromeDriver executable (compatible with your Chrome browser version)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facebook-login-automation.git
   cd facebook-login-automation
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the appropriate ChromeDriver executable and place it in the same directory as the script. You can download ChromeDriver from the [official website](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

## Usage

1. Open the `login_form.py` script and replace the placeholders with your Facebook login credentials:

   ```python
   username = "your_facebook_username"
   password = "your_facebook_password"
   ```

2. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m login_form.py
   ```

3. The script will open a Chrome browser window, navigate to Facebook's login page, enter your credentials, and log you in. After logging in, the browser window will remain open, allowing you to interact with the web page as needed.

4. To end the script, manually close the browser window or terminate the script using Ctrl+C.

**Important Note:**

- This script is for educational purposes and should be used responsibly and in compliance with Facebook's terms of use.
- Web scraping and automation can have ethical and legal implications. Always make sure you have the necessary permissions and follow best practices.
